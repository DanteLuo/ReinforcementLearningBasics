# Dyna-Q, Dyna-Q+ and Prioritized Sweeping

## Questions:

All the algorithm here are tabular methods and were tested in the
OPENAI Gym FrozenLake Environment

1. Implementation of Dyna-Q
2. Implementation of Dyna-Q+
3. Comparision of Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+
4. Implementation of Prioritized Sweeping

## How to run:

1. First, install all the requirements in terminal by pip:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Second, download2 the modified environment from canvas.
3. Third, open terminal and run:
``` 
python3.X hw2.py -q Y
```

X is your python version and Y is the question number.
For a more detailed description of question number, please run:
```
python3.X hw2.py -h
```

PS: If you would like to change the hyperparameters please check hw2.py


## Test case:

I've wrote a test case with 5x5 environment. To run the test case,
run the hw_test.py file
