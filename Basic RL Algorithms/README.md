# Basic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

## What's inside?

It is a mixture of the most basic reinforcement learning algorithm:
1. Multi-arm Bandits
2. Policy Evaluation
3. Policy Iteration
4. Value Iteration
5. Monte Carlo Control
6. Q Learning

For a detail reference to this method, [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](
http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html) is the best book
to check out.

## How to run?
Mixture_RL.py is the file that contains all the 6 algorithm implementation
under [OPENAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) FrozenLake environment.
Do check out their github and you will find more fun games to play with.

It plot Q table and policy depends on algorithm.

Just check how it works and compare their performance is a fun thing to do.

PS: The API is in the Mixture_RL.py file, in case you want to run your own
game with those algorithm.
